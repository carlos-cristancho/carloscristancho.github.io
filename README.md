# Cristancho Clavijo's Portfolio
Welcome to my professional portfolio! Iâ€™m Carlos Cristancho, a software developer with experience in C++, Python, and Agile methodologies.

## About Me
Passionate about technology and problem-solving, I specialize in task automation, software development for control and instrumentation, and implementing productivity tools.

## Featured Projects
**EngineFourierAnalyzer (https://github.com/cristanchoclavijo/EngineFourierAnalyzer)**: is a project designed to analyze signals and decompose them into their frequency components using the FFTW library and C++. This software aims to be an efficient and flexible tool for performing Fourier analysis in industrial applications, with a particular focus on fault detection in rotating machinery and predictive maintenance.

**FolderSyncTask (https://github.com/cristanchoclavijo/FolderSyncTask)**: is a Python-based project designed to synchronize the contents of two directories, source and replica, by comparing files and subdirectories. The program ensures that any new files, modified files, or deleted files in the source folder are accurately reflected in the replica folder, maintaining consistency between both directories.

## Technical Skills
**Languages**: C++, Python, C#, Java
**Methodologies**: Agile, SCRUM, Kanban
**Tools**: Git, GitHub, Visual Studio, Simulink, LabVIEW.

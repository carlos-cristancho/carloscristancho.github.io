                    <h3>Professional Profile</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am an Electronics Engineer specializing in Industrial Instrumentation and Control. I 
                        have work experience with Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) used in the hydrocarbon 
                        sector, actively participating in the development of Inspection, Testing, and Preventive 
                        and Predictive Maintenance (IPMP) plans that ensure the reliable and safe operation of 
                        the safety instrumented functions within a given SIS.<br><br>
                        This work experience, gained through developing IPMP plans using RCM methodology 
                        (following standards such as SAE JA1011, SAE JA1012, SAE J1739, ISO 14224, OREDA 
                        database, among other industry standards), also extends to the instrumentation of 
                        distributed control systems (DCS). Additionally, I have professional experience with 
                        the instrumentation used in fire and gas systems, where the IPMP plan is developed 
                        according to NFPA 25, NFPA 72 standards, among others.<br><br>
                        I also have work experience in applying the RBI methodology (following standards such 
                        as API 580, API 581, API 576, API 510, API 520, API 521, API 527, ASME I, ASME VIII, 
                        among other industry standards) for developing IPMP plans for safety valves, relief 
                        valves, and safety-relief valves, as well as other PRD-type protective devices.<br><br>
                        As a senior member of the International Society of Automation (ISA), I have received, 
                        through the Colombia section, in-depth training on technical standards IEC 61508 and 
                        IEC 61511, which regulate the SIS lifecycle. Additionally, I have gained access to 
                        technical standards ISA 18.1 and ISA 18.2, which regulate both the management of alarm 
                        sequences used in industrial control systems and the lifecycle of these alarms.<br><br>                        
                        Furthermore, I have carried out preventive and corrective maintenance of the 
                        instrumentation necessary for the reliable and safe operation of gas compressors and 
                        electricity generators (powered either by turbines or engines using natural gas as fuel). 
                        I have also executed maintenance on the instrumentation of crude oil production wells, 
                        water or gas injection wells, three-phase separators, steam boilers, industrial burners, 
                        and other systems used in the oil industry.<br><br>                        
                        For this, I have performed control loop diagnostics and instrumentation calibration using 
                        EMERSON’s HART 475 and AMS TREX COMMUNICATOR field communicators, FLUKE’s 754 and 725 
                        process calibrators, along with the 789 process meter and the 9144 dry block, also from 
                        FLUKE.<br><br>                        
                        Additionally, I have experience with specialized software, including SAP GUI for Windows 
                        770, APM Predix, STUDIO 5000, TIA PORTAL V16, LOGO!Soft Comfort V8.2, ValveVue, AutoCAD 
                        PID 2020, FluidSIM Pneumatics 4.5, Matlab 2020, NI LabVIEW 2020, Proteus 8 Professional, 
                        DAQMaster, PACTware 4.1, Visual Studio Code, Apache NetBeans, among others.

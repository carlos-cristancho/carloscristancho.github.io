                        I have applied object-oriented programming principles and agile methodologies 
                        to ensure that the results not only meet functional requirements but also 
                        optimize resources and improve productivity.<br><br>
                        My passion for technology has led me to tackle complex problems and design 
                        scalable solutions that can be adapted to different environments. I invite you 
                        to explore each of these projects, developed to solve technical challenges in

                <p>
                    Hi, I am Carlos Cristancho, a software developer passionate about object-oriented 
                    programming and solving complex problems. I use Agile methodologies such as Scrum 
                    and Kanban to manage project development, ensuring that each delivery meets 
                    efficiency and scalability standards. I specialize in backend development and in 
                    creating desktop and mobile applications, implementing solutions that optimize 
                    processes and improve organizational productivity.<br><br>
                    My experience in Instrumentation and Industrial Control includes the maintenance of 
                    transmitters and safety valves, where I have worked on the installation, 
                    configuration, and diagnosis of critical equipment. I have ensured that these 
                    devices operate reliably and accurately, contributing to the safety and efficiency 
                    of industrial plants. Additionally, I have led preventive and corrective maintenance 
                    activities on various industrial control equipment.<br><br>                
                    I also have extensive experience in developing maintenance plans based on the RCM 
                    (Reliability-Centered Maintenance) methodology for safety instrumented systems (SIS) 
                    and basic process control systems (BPCS), as well as the RBI (Risk-Based Inspection) 
                    methodology applied to safety, relief, and safety-relief valves. Additionally, I 
                    have designed and executed maintenance plans for fire protection systems, ensuring 
                    operability and compliance with safety regulations in industrial facilities.
